## Problem Statment

1. Currently, the user has to set the API key and  device id every time with cloud URL.

    For example.
    
    `http://cloud.boltiot.com/remote/abc061df-bef5-4881-b54e-a73099e3f66b/digitalWrite?pin=0&state=LOW&deviceName=BOLTxXXXXX`

2. The user has to install the request library by himself and there is a learning curve of request library of itself.
    For example.
    
    `pip install requests`
    ```python
    import requests 
    urlON="http://cloud.boltiot.com/remote/YourDeviceAPI/ONCommand&deviceName=BOLTxxxxxxx"
    urlOFF="http://cloud.boltiot.com/remote/YourDeviceAPI/OFFCommand&deviceName=BOLTxxxxxxx" 
    r=requests.get(urlON) 
    r=requests.get(urlOFF)
    ```
## Expected Solution

1. User need to type just one command

    `pip install bolt`
    

2. The user will set the client once and he can use the same client for every operation.
    For example.
    
    `pip install requests`
    ```python
    from bolt import Client
    api_key = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    device_id  = â€œBOLT1234"
    client = Client(api_key, device_id)
    response = client.digitalWrite('0', 'HIGH')
    ```
