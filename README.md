# bolt-api-python

## Goal
The goal of this library is to provide an easy to use interface of Bolt Cloud API's. The functions will be quite similar to the Raspberry Pi and Arduino functions.


## Installation 

1. Users need to type just one command

    `pip install boltiot`
    

2. The user will set the client once and he can use the same client for every operation.
    For example.
    
    ```python
    from boltiot import Bolt
    api_key = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    device_id  = “BOLT1234"
    mybolt = Bolt(api_key, device_id)
    response = client.digitalWrite('0', 'HIGH')
    ```
##  GPIO Functions

1. digitalWrite Command
    
    ```python
    from boltiot import Bolt
    api_key = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    device_id  = “BOLT1234"
    mybolt = Bolt(api_key, device_id)
    response = mybolt.digitalWrite('0', 'HIGH')
    ```
 2. digitalRead Command
    
    ```python
    from boltiot import Bolt
    api_key = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    device_id  = “BOLT1234"
    mybolt = Bolt(api_key, device_id)
    response = mybolt.digitalRead('A0')
    ```
 3. analogRead Command
    
    ```python
    from boltiot import Bolt
    api_key = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    device_id  = “BOLT1234"
    mybolt = Bolt(api_key, device_id)
    response = mybolt.analogRead('A0')
    ```
 4. analogWrite Command
    
    ```python
    from boltiot import Bolt
    api_key = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    device_id  = “BOLT1234"
    mybolt = Bolt(api_key, device_id)
    response = mybolt.analogWrite('0', '100')
    ```

##  UART Functions

1. serialBegin Command
    
    ```python
    from boltiot import Bolt
    api_key = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    device_id  = “BOLT1234"
    mybolt = Bolt(api_key, device_id)
    response = mybolt.serialBegin('9600')
    ```
 2. serialWrite Command
    
    ```python
    from boltiot import Bolt
    api_key = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    device_id  = “BOLT1234"
    mybolt = Bolt(api_key, device_id)
    response = mybolt.serialWrite('Hello')
    ```
3. serialRead Command
       
    ```python
    from boltiot import Bolt
    api_key = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    device_id  = “BOLT1234"
    mybolt = Bolt(api_key, device_id)
    response = mybolt.serialRead('10')
    ```
 ##  Utility Functions
1. isOnline Command (to check recent status of device with time when status updated)
    
    ```python
    from boltiot import Bolt
    api_key = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    device_id  = “BOLT1234"
    mybolt = Bolt(api_key, device_id)
    response = mybolt.isOnline()
    ```
    
2. restart Command (to restart the Bolt)
    
    ```python
    from boltiot import Bolt
    api_key = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    device_id  = “BOLT1234"
    mybolt = Bolt(api_key, device_id)
    response = mybolt.restart()
    ```
 3. version Command (to check device version)
    
    ```python
    from boltiot import Bolt
    api_key = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    device_id  = “BOLT1234"
    mybolt = Bolt(api_key, device_id)
    response = mybolt.version()
    ```
 ##  Alert Functions
1. send_sms function is used to send email using twilio API .
    
    ```python
    from boltiot import Sms
    ssid = 'You can find SSID in your Twilio Dashboard' 
    auth_token = 'You can find  on your Twilio Dashboard' 
    from_number = 'This is the no. generated by Twilio. You can find this on your Twilio Dashboard'
    to_number = 'number to send the sms'
    sms = Sms(ssid, auth_token, to_number, from_number)
    sms.send_sms("Messge to be sent")
    ```
2. send_email function is used to send emails using mailgun API .
    
    ```python
    from boltiot import Email
    mailgun_api_key = 'This is the private API key which you can find on your Mailgun Dashboard' 
    sandbox_url= 'You can find this on your Mailgun Dashboard' 
    sender_email = 'This would be test@your SANDBOX_URL'
    recipient_email = 'Enter your Email ID Here'
    mailer = Email(mailgun_api_key, sandbox_url, sender_email, recipient_email)
    mailer.send_email("Email Subject", "Email Body")
